# Introduction
## Statement

This a demonstration of how R Markdown works. The value R Markdown to a data scientist **cannot** be overestimated. This a way of making our research to be reproducible, *something of very high value in our interconnected world*. **_We are going higher with these tools_**!!!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
pairs(cars)
```

This is my second attempt at sharing this content.

```{r second-chunk}
df <- data.frame(x = sample(1:5, 30, replace = T), y = sample(letters[1:5], 30, replace = TRUE))
df
nrow(df)
```


In our data frame `df` has `r nrow(df)` rows and `r ncol(df)` columns.
