We said that the Coefficient of Variation "is the ratio between the standard deviation and the mean, expressed as a percentage".
Task: Create this function.

--- 

Note: Your function should:

- Receive only a vector of numbers as input and throw an error that says "Illegal input" when this is violated.
- Should work only for vectors with at least 2 elements and at the most 100 elements. If any of these are violated, throw an error that says "The vector is either too short or too long".
- In the script write first the definition of your function and then a few test cases below.
