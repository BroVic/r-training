```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Control flow
### Conditionals

- `if`, `else if`, `else`: These can be used to instruct a particular part of the code to be run or not run.

- For example take this instruction:  
*If `x` is greater than `y`, print "Yes o!", otherwise print "No way!"*

---

- Using R code, it would look like this:

``` {r control_flow, eval = FALSE}
# Note that x is 8 and y is 2
if (x > y) {
  "Yes o!"
} else {
  "No way!"
}
```

*When the expression in `if()` is `TRUE`, the code in that part is executed. If `FALSE`, the `else` part is executed*.    

**What is the result?**

## Loops

Loops allow us to run a code block over and over again.

For a simple explanation of loops, read **[this article](https://adventureswithr.wordpress.com/2020/08/11/r-loops/)**.

## Read data from a file
_Task: Read a table from a CSV file called **mockdata.csv**_.

---

Use `read.csv()` function to read the file into R and at the same time create an object called `mydata`.

```{r read_csv}
mydata <- read.csv("mockdata.csv")

# Print out the data inside R
mydata
```
